Code is a Streamlit application designed to interact with the arXiv API to fetch, display, and summarize scholarly articles related to a user-specified query, such as "machine learning." It demonstrates an effective use of Python libraries for HTTP requests, XML parsing, data manipulation, and utilizing machine learning models for text summarization.

Overview of the Code Functionality:
Fetching Metadata from arXiv:

The fetch_arxiv_metadata function constructs and sends a GET request to the arXiv API with a user-defined query and a specified maximum number of results. It retrieves the metadata of articles as XML content.
Parsing XML Content:

parse_metadata takes the XML response from the arXiv API and extracts titles, abstracts, and article links using BeautifulSoup for XML parsing.
Text Summarization:

Initializes a text summarization pipeline using Hugging Face's transformers library with the model "sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6".
The summarize_abstracts function applies this pipeline to the list of abstracts, producing a summarized version of each.
Streamlit Interface:

Utilizes Streamlit to create an interactive web interface where users can input a search query and the maximum number of articles to fetch and summarize.
Once the user initiates the fetch process, the application displays a spinner indicating that the articles are being fetched and summarized.
Results are presented in a pandas DataFrame, shown directly in the Streamlit application, providing a clear and structured overview of article titles, their summaries, and links to the full articles on arXiv.
Report:
This Streamlit application offers a practical tool for researchers, educators, and enthusiasts to quickly access and comprehend the latest scholarly articles in their field of interest. By entering a search term and specifying how many articles to retrieve, users can efficiently get a snapshot of recent publications, including succinct summaries that highlight the essence of each article's contribution.
